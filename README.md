**Project Title: Stack Overflow SDE Salary Analysis and Prediction**

**Overview**

This project explores insights from the 2023 Stack Overflow Software Developer Engineer (SDE)  salary dataset and provides tools for analysis and salary prediction. Key features include:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparation of the salary dataset.
* **Model Comparison:** Implementation and evaluation of:
    * Linear Regression
    * Decision Tree Regressor
    * Random Forest Regressor
* **GridSearchCV:** Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
* **Streamlit App:** Interactive web application for:
    1. **Salary Prediction:** Estimates SDE salary based on country, years of experience, and education level.
    2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualizes salary trends across countries, experience levels, and other factors.

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* Libraries:
    * Pandas (for data manipulation)
    * NumPy (for numerical computations)
    * Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
    * Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualizations)
    * Streamlit (for web app)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sde-salary-predictor
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Dataset**

* The project utilizes the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey dataset (or a similar source).
* Indicate where to obtain the dataset if not included in the repository.

**Project Structure**

* **data.csv:** The cleaned and processed Stack Overflow salary dataset.
* **analysis.py:**  Script for exploratory analysis and generating visualizations. 
* **models.py:**  Script for model training, comparison, and hyperparameter tuning.
* **app.py:** Streamlit application code.

**Usage**

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Interact with the web app for salary prediction and data exploration.

**Future Improvements**

* Incorporate additional features into the prediction model.
* Provide more interactive visualizations in the Streamlit app.
* Expand the analysis to include other relevant factors influencing SDE salaries.
